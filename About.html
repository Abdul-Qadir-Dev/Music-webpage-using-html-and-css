        In 2010, 17-year-old Malik auditioned in Manchester for the seventh series of reality-television competition The
        X Factor. On the morning of the audition, Malik became nervous and did not want to attend, but his mother
        eventually forced him out of bed and coaxed him into going. He sang "Let Me Love You" by Mario as his audition
        song and was accepted into the next round. Upon auditioning for The X Factor, Malik stated that he was "looking
        for an experience".He was eliminated before the final round of the competition,but judges Nicole Scherzinger and
        Simon Cowell grouped him with fellow competitors Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson to
        form a new act for the remainder of the show, the boy band that would become known as One Direction.The group
        quickly gained popularity in the UK, finished in third place, and were subsequently signed by Cowell to a
        reported £2 million Syco Records record contract. They subsequently signed in North America with Columbia
        Records.

        A book licensed by One Direction, One Direction: Forever Young (Our Official X Factor Story), released in
        February 2011, topped The Sunday Times' Best Seller list.[25][26] The same month, the boy band performed for
        500,000 people throughout the UK as part of the X Factor Live Tour. The group's debut studio album Up All Night

        first UK group to have their debut album reach number one in the United States.It topped the charts in 16

        Australia, respectively. Subsequent singles, "Gotta Be You" and "One Thing", became top ten hits in the UK.
        Following the release of the album, the band embarked on the Up All Night Tour. Initially intended to be solely
        a UK tour, various dates in North America and Australia were added due to demand. Up All Night: The Live Tour, a
        video album documenting the tour, was released in May 2012. That same month, One Direction's first book to be
        licensed in America, Dare to Dream: Life as One Direction, was published and topped The New York Times Best
